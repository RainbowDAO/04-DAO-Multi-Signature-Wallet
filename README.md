## 1.Project name

DAO Multi-Signature Wallet System

## 2.Elevator pitch

Our DAO multi-signature wallet system is an upgrading based on gnosis-safe. It can not only be upgraded by changing parameters, but also stored in the DeFi protocol.

##  Project Story

### 1.Inspiration

The DAO multi-signature wallet management system is another important innovation in our DAO infrastructure product. The design of this product is mainly inspired by the famous multi-signature wallet gnosis-safe but our system is an upgrading based on it. Fund management is the core module of various types of DAO organizations, managing the funds of community in the form of multi-signature. However, functions of the existing multi-signature wallet system are still too simple. To counter this, we have developed the DAO multi-signature wallet management system.

### 2.What it does

Our DAO multi-signature wallet management system is an upgrading based on gnosis-safe, which has the existing functions of gnosis-safe and some unique capabilities.

This multi-signature wallet system focuses on two shortages of DAO organization:

(1) Our wallet system can be upgraded through governance.

When the gnosis-safe multi-signature wallet system is established, all its parameters are fixed, such as the multi-signature address and control parameters, they are all set and cannot be upgraded. However, our system allows two improvements. First, the existing multi-signature signers can be changed; second, the multi-signature control parameters can be altered. For example, 3/6 control parameters can be changed to 4/9. In this way, the upgradeability of the DAO multi-signature wallet is realized.

(2) By establishing Defi controller, we can deposit the funds of multi-signature wallet into various DeFi protocols, so that the funds in the multi-signature wallet can increase in value and gain additional income. That is also a major innovation.

### 3.How we built it

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainbowDAO/04-DAO-Multi-Signature-Wallet/main/PIC/Logic-diagram.png)

DAO multi-signature wallet system has the following functions:

(1) Establishment of DAO multi-signature. Anyone can establish their multi-signature wallet system among different wallet addresses, set multi-signature control parameters and approve the use of funds in the form of multi-signature;

(2) Upgrading in DAO multi-signature wallet protocol. For gnosis-safe, once the multi-signature contract is deployed, the information of the contract cannot be changed. In contrast, in our contract, signers and signing conditions of multi-signature can be changed through multi-signature review and approval. Hence, funds in DAO can be managed more flexibly;

(3) DeFi controller. Funds in the vault can be used to increase liquidity in decentralized exchanges through multi-signature to obtain benefits generated by liquidity; or, funds in the vault can be deposited and withdrawn from lending platforms to attain benefit through multi-signature. These two functions can help to activate the precipitation funds in the multi-signature wallet, so that the value of funds can be increased through various DeFi protocols to maximize the efficiency of the use of funds.
